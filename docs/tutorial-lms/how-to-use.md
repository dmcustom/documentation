# How to Use

Since LMS uses the Avatar Contact system for detection. Therefore, you must enable player-to-player contact permissions in the game setting menu. Otherwise, LMS will not work!

By default, the system can detect penetration or interaction with SPS Sockets and the avatar’s hands. If you would like LMS to detect interactions with other objects beyond these, please refer to [How to Add Contact](./faq#how-to-add-a-contact-and-make-it-interact-with-pcs)

## 1. Setting Avatar Interaction
These are the required in-game settings that must be configured to enable the Avatar Contact system.

- **Pause Avatar Interaction** > `OFF`
- **Avatar Allowed to Interact** > `Friends, Everyone`
- **Avatar Self Interact** > `ON`

## 2. Enable LMS
1. Go inside the LMS menu and toggle `ON` the menu named **ON/OFF**
2. Getting insertion from a hand or SPS Socket to generate sounds.

:::tip Tip
If you are in the Insertive Role (the one who performs the movement), you can use **Self-Service** mode for easier triggering.
This menu allows you to generate sounds based on your own movements, even without interacting with another person's hole.

:::tip Tip
When using a futa avatar (an avatar with penis and pussy), LMS may eventually become interrupted and stop generating sounds.
This happens because LMS can detect the owner’s own SPS Socket. Setting the **Self-Touch** menu to `OFF` will resolve this issue.
