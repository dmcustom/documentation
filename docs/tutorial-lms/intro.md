## About
Lovestick Massages SFX (LMS) is a sound system that detects avatar interactions and generates responsive audio effects similar to PCS. It is specifically designed for male avatars or any avatar equipped with a penetrator component.

What differentiates it is its role when used with the SPS Plug. Unlike PCS, which functions more like the receiving side of an interaction, this system is designed from the perspective of the penetrating role. As a result, it includes features and mechanics tailored to male anatomy, such as climax sound effects and a pleasure gauge system that visually represents arousal levels in a style similar to hentai-inspired game mechanics.

## Additional Terms for Avatar Distributors
This section applies to distributors of pre-made avatars with LMS pre-installed, as well as individuals who offer Avatar Commission services that include LMS installation for clients.

### In the Case of Sellers or Commissioners
**Seller** refers to an individual who customizes or creates pre-made avatars for the purpose of resale on platforms or marketplaces such as Gumroad, Jinxxy, or other similar services.

**Commissioner / Service Provider** refers to an individual who is hired to create or customize an avatar according to a client’s specific requirements, operating on a per-project basis within the agreed scope of work.

You are required to obtain a `Commercial Use License` if you intend to install LMS on avatars that will be sold, or on avatars created or modified under commission.

When exporting an avatar package, you must exclude the LMS script files from the package in order to prevent unauthorized redistribution of the system.
  - The script folder that must be excluded is located at: `Assets/!Dismay Custom/Lovestick Massages SFX/Editor/Scripts`.
<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/pcs-script.png')} width="540" /> 
:::info Info
Your customers will still be able to use LMS normally even without the script files, provided that you **ensure all files within the #GENERATED folder are properly exported** and included in the package.
:::

### In the Case of an Avatar Buyer
An **Avatar Buyer** refers to an individual who purchases a pre-made avatar through platforms or websites such as Gumroad, Jinxxy, or other similar marketplaces for personal use only, without any intention of reselling or redistributing the avatar.

- You are not required to purchase or own LMS in order to buy or use an avatar that already has LMS installed.
- You may purchase a `Personal Use License` of LMS separately if you wish to update the system version or further modify/customize the LMS settings on the avatar you have purchased.

### In the Case of a Client
A **Client** refers to an individual who hires a service provider to create, customize, or install systems (including LMS) on an avatar according to their specific requirements, without any intention of reselling the completed work.

- You are required to have a LMS `Personal Use License`, and you are not required to have a `Commercial Use License` in order to commission the work.
- For clearer understanding:
  - The Client uses a `Personal Use License` only.
  - The Commissioner must use a `Commercial Use License` to perform the work.
- However, if you take any action that changes your status — for example, reselling the commissioned avatar for profit after completion — you will immediately be considered a **Seller** and must comply with the terms and conditions applicable to Sellers separately.
