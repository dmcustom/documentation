## About
Penetration Contact System (PCS) is an advanced interaction-based sound system that detects avatar contact and generates dynamic audio feedback. It can detect up to 5 different types of penetration-related interactions, including variations in intensity, in-and-out motion rhythm, sliding, pulling out, and more.

In addition, PCS includes a moan sound system and an arousal point mechanic designed to simulate a H-game like, enhancing immersion and responsiveness during interactions.

## Additional Terms for Avatar Distributors
This section applies to distributors of pre-made avatars with PCS pre-installed, as well as individuals who offer Avatar Commission services that include PCS installation for clients.

### In the Case of Sellers or Commissioners
**Seller** refers to an individual who customizes or creates pre-made avatars for the purpose of resale on platforms or marketplaces such as Gumroad, Jinxxy, or other similar services.

**Commissioner / Service Provider** refers to an individual who is hired to create or customize an avatar according to a client’s specific requirements, operating on a per-project basis within the agreed scope of work.

You are required to obtain a `Commercial Use License` if you intend to install PCS on avatars that will be sold, or on avatars created or modified under commission.

When exporting an avatar package, you must exclude the PCS script files from the package in order to prevent unauthorized redistribution of the system.
  - The script folder that must be excluded is located at: `Assets/!Dismay Custom/Penetration Contact System/Editor/Scripts`.
<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/pcs-script.png')} width="540" /> 
:::info Info
Your customers will still be able to use PCS normally even without the script files, provided that you **ensure all files within the #GENERATED folder are properly exported** and included in the package.
:::

### In the Case of an Avatar Buyer
An **Avatar Buyer** refers to an individual who purchases a pre-made avatar through platforms or websites such as Gumroad, Jinxxy, or other similar marketplaces for personal use only, without any intention of reselling or redistributing the avatar.

- You are not required to purchase or own PCS in order to buy or use an avatar that already has PCS installed.
- You may purchase a `Personal Use License` of PCS separately if you wish to update the system version or further modify/customize the PCS settings on the avatar you have purchased.

### In the Case of a Client
A **Client** refers to an individual who hires a service provider to create, customize, or install systems (including PCS) on an avatar according to their specific requirements, without any intention of reselling the completed work.

- You are required to have a PCS `Personal Use License`, and you are not required to have a `Commercial Use License` in order to commission the work.
- For clearer understanding:
  - The Client uses a `Personal Use License` only.
  - The Commissioner must use a `Commercial Use License` to perform the work.
- However, if you take any action that changes your status — for example, reselling the commissioned avatar for profit after completion — you will immediately be considered a **Seller** and must comply with the terms and conditions applicable to Sellers separately.
