## Commercial Use

### For Content Creator
This includes streamers, VTubers, and anyone involved in producing commercial video content.
- You must own a `Commercial License` if you use it on **Live Stream**, **Subscription Video** or  **Paid Video** (commercial contents)

:::note Info
*At this time, there is no need to register for a Commercial Use, I will temporary continue to operate on a trust-based system.
(though this may change in the near future, which may require your vrc name, contact email, and your streaming profile link).*
:::

### For Avatar Seller
- It would be highly appreciated if you credit **Dismay Custom** and **PCS** on your shop page.
- You must exclude PCS script files from your exported avatar package to prevent re-distribution.
  - The script folder is located in: `Assets/!Dismay Custom/Penetration Contact System/Editor/Scripts`.

- Your customer still can use PCS normally without the scripts. **Just make sure that all #GENERATE assets are exported as well.**
- Your customer doesn't have to buy PCS to use it. They can buy it if they want to update and change things.
